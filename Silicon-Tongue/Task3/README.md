# Introduction
Computers dont understand our language and to communicate they use binary values. But to convey information they not only use Binary, they use Hexadedcimal, Octals, Ascii, etc. 

This task will have you interact with 2 new components, LCD display and 4x4 input keypad.

To make and test your circuit, you will use this [website](https://www.tinkercad.com/). All the parts required for this task can be found there alongside a plethora of other very very interesting components that we insist on you to explore.

# Task 3A

Your task should you choose to accept it is to
- Input data using 4x4 input keypad and have it display it on the LCD
- Input decimal values, convert them to Hexadecimal values and show them on the LCD.

# Task 3B

- Utilize all the keys on the keypad and add functions.
	The functionality should be
	- remap "*" and "#" to be 'E' and 'F'.
	- Enter Hexadecimal values on the keypad.
	- press a push button attached seperately to trigger that the Hex phrase has been entered and is ready to be processed and displayed.

# Learning Outcomes
- Understand the working of the 4x4 keypad
- Use the LCD with Arduino
