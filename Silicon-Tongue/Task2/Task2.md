# Introduction

Motors are present everywhere around us, ranging from a vibration motor in your phone to fans to their application in electric cars. One of the most basic functions is to be able to control their speed.

One of the things you will find is that a motor works on voltages and current values that cannot be provided by our microcontroller directly.

To make and test your circuit, you will use this [website](https://www.tinkercad.com/). All the parts required for this task can be found there alongside a plethora of other very very interesting components that we insist on you to explore.

# Task 2A

Your task should you choose to accept it is to
- Interface a DC motor with Arduino using L293D IC
- Understand PWM
- Use a Potentiometer to change the speed of the motor
- Use the same potentiometer to change the brightness of an LED simultaneously.

# Task 2B
- have the motor speed behave inversely to the brightness of the LED. (If you turn the potentiometer, LED brightens up and motor slows down, and vice versa).

# Learning Outcomes
- To be able to find and read a datasheet
- Get started with Arduino
- To understand the pin layout of the L293D IC
- Understand PWM.

# Getting Started
You will first have to get started with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/). Then Find and read the datasheet of L293D. Placing and building the circuit should be straight forward, however if you face any issues, first try googling or youtubing the problem. Please approach us if this fails.
