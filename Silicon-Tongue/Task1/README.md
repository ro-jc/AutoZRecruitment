# Introduction

Welcome to the first task in embedded electronics. To be here means you are interested in learning about this vast and interconnected field. This task is to help us understand your understanding and learning capabilities. We would also like you to remember throughout the process that if you face any issues during the process, please feel free to approach us at any time through the discord server.

Counting is one of the most basic things any machine can do. It is pretty important for all the operations performed by a controller are in sync to ensure smooth operation. For a controller to count it needs a clock through which it can count the time elapsed (just like how we count seconds). One of the most simple Integrated Circuit is called a 555 timer.  This is a very versatile IC and can be used to generate clock pulses of many sorts.

To make and test your circuit, you will use this [website](https://www.tinkercad.com/). All the parts required for this task can be found there alongside a plethora of other very very interesting components that we insist on you to explore.

# Task

Your task should you choose to accept it is to
- Utilize this IC to make a railway signal
- Find a way to change the frequency of this signal
- (optional) get creative with your signals

The pattern can be of your choosing and you can find documentation online as well. A simple pattern would be 2 lights flashing one after another at a set frequency. 

Please google as much as you can to get through this and the upcoming tasks.

# Learning Outcomes
- To be able to find and read a datasheet
- To understand the pin layout of the 555 timer
- understand different parts of a circuit and the consequences of changing different aspects of said circuit.

# Getting Started

Start out by reading the datasheets of the components you are using. Placing and building the circuit should be straight forward, however if you face any issues, first try googling or youtubing the problem. Please approach us if this fails.
