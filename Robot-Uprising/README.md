Welcome to the set of tasks for autonomous systems and controls. These tasks are designed in a way to get you started in this field. Appropriate resources have been provide to gain the knowledge required to complete these tasks. Through these tasks, we are also looking to evaluate your self learning capabilities; your competency with assimilating random facts from the internet and/or other resources to teach yourself a skill. Please maintain a github repository with updates and commits against any milestone you deem important. You will be asked to submit this for us to evaluate your performance. Do add a separate folder in the repository called 'Outputs'. We will be expecting you to add all the deliverables, i.e.; the screenshots or the screen recordings of the outputs you mananged to get as a result of completing the task(s). In case you aren't able to complete the task, please add whatever partial output you were able to obtain. As mentioned above, we are trying to evaluate your self learning ability, and we understand that failure/not getting the desirable outcome is a huge part of it.


Feel free to reach out to us on [discord](https://discord.com/invite/fJZegXhe) if you have any doubts. There will be a separate channel for this task for you to post queries.

# Prerequisite

We need the following software for completing the tasks and further tasks!
1. [Ubuntu 20.04 OS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/focal/)
    - It may be in virtual machine, or the host itself
    - RAM : 4GB +
    - Storage : 50GB+
2.  [ROS Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu)

You will need to have a functional knowledge of programming; either in C/C++ or in Python. For now, are pushing towards getting the required output(s), and not the efficiency of algorithms, so your choice of language is not going to affect your evaluation.
