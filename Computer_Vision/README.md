# Computer Vision

**Computer vision** is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to extract useful information from digital photos, videos, and other visual inputs. 

In the field of **robotics**, Computer Vision enables a robot to "see" its environment. Developers then write supporting code that helps the bot in taking decsions based on what it is "seeing". The algorithms that support this **perception** form a part of Artificial Intelligence. These algorithms are responsible for decision taking and therefore the working of the robots.

## Perception in Team AutoZ 
Our maiden robot, **Pratham**, and VIT's first L3 Autonomous Car utilises Computer Vision to see what is coming up ahead of him. It uses a combination of **Python OpenCV**, along with **Nvidia's Jetson Inference** to process camera input data, process it into meaningfull information, and then take mission critical actions. 
Along with the RGB input, we use lidars and depth cameras to percieve what is around the robot. The use of point clouds and depth data are always critical in the development here in **TeamAutoZ** 


## Perception Tasks 
The repository contains Perception tasks for Recruitment 2022-23. The complexity of the tasks are increased in each level. We expect you to start from Level 1 and slowly move above. It is not necessary that you complete all the tasks with perfection to get recruited. We will be assessing you based on how much you learned and improved from the tasks. The more you do , more will be your chances of getting recruited. 

Focus on learning and not the result.

**All the Best**

**Have Fun**
